I am a computer science student at CSUF, and I expect to graduate in 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 2, part 1
  
  This was one of my favorites because I have always loved math. Learning how to make a program to do the calculations was mind-blowing. I was able to code PEMDAS while using integer variables to store the results of our analyses.

* Lab 5, part 2
  
  This was interesting because it taught us how to convert types. Using static_cast, we can change integers to doubles quickly in the middle of a code. I was able to grab the number of feet the user input and converted it to inches efficiently. 

* Lab 6, part 2
  
  This was my favorite lab because I really enjoy playing blackjack with my family. Understanding how blackjack could be coded added another level of excitement. I could write functions for all numbers of the deck and use a bool type to check if a blackjack was reached or not.
